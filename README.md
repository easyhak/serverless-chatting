# Slack Clone Coding By Using Serverless Stack
It is a slack clone application made using aws serverless stack.   
This repository contains only the backend technology.   
If you want to go frontend code go to this <a href="#">repository</a>

## Stack 
- Python3
- Serverless Framework
- AWS Lambda, AWS ApiGateway
- AWS Cognito User Pool
- AWS DynamoDB

## Prerequisites
1. Need to create an aws account
2. Install Serverless Framework
    ```sh
    npm install -g serverless
    ```
3. Install AWS Cli and Configure your CLI user   
   - <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-welcome.html">Install AWS CLI</a>
   - <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-configure.html">Configure the AWS CLI</a>
4. Setting AWS Cognito User Pool
    - in this application case we set Post confirmation Lambda trigger
    - this lambda code is in <a href="#">Here<a/>
    - you need to manually set the content for this code

## Setup

```bash
npm install -g serverless
```

## Deploy

you can simply deploy enter this command 

```bash
serverless deploy
```

The expected result should be similar to:

```shell
Running "serverless" from node_modules

## Scaling

### AWS Lambda

By default, AWS Lambda limits the total concurrent executions across all functions within a given region to 1000. The default limit is a safety limit that protects you from costs due to potential runaway or recursive functions during initial development and testing. To increase this limit above the default, follow the steps in [To request a limit increase for concurrent executions](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/concurrent-executions.html#increase-concurrent-executions-limit).

### DynamoDB

When you create a table, you specify how much provisioned throughput capacity you want to reserve for reads and writes. DynamoDB will reserve the necessary resources to meet your throughput needs while ensuring consistent, low-latency performance. You can change the provisioned throughput and increasing or decreasing capacity as needed.

This is can be done via settings in the `serverless.yml`.

```yaml
  ProvisionedThroughput:
    ReadCapacityUnits: 1
    WriteCapacityUnits: 1
```

In case you expect a lot of traffic fluctuation we recommend to checkout this guide on how to auto scale DynamoDB [https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/auto-scale-dynamodb-with-dynamic-dynamodb/](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/auto-scale-dynamodb-with-dynamic-dynamodb/)
